# This course introduces fundamental numerical methods for solving problems in science and engineering. Topics will include:

Root-finding methods: Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant method, and their convergence analysis.
Linear systems: Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, iterative methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel), and applications to linear least squares.
Interpolation and approximation: Polynomial interpolation (Lagrange, Newton), spline interpolation, least squares approximation, and Fourier series.
Numerical differentiation and integration: Finite difference methods, numerical quadrature (trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule), and Gaussian quadrature.
Ordinary differential equations: Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods, and applications to initial value problems.

# Homework Assignments:
Homework assignments will involve implementing and analyzing numerical methods using MATLAB. Students will be expected to:
Write MATLAB code: Implement the algorithms discussed in class.
Conduct numerical experiments: Test the accuracy and efficiency of the implemented methods.
Analyze results: Interpret the results of the numerical experiments and compare different methods.
Present findings: Clearly document the code and present the results in written reports or presentations.
